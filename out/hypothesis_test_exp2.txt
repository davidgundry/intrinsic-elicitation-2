Analysing dataset data 

Hypothesis 1: Enjoyment (DV1) will be greater in the game condition than the task condition.
    A one-tailed two-sample t-test will be used to test whether the mean scores of DV1 is greater
    in the game condition than the task condition. α = 0.05.

Hypothesis 2: Proportion of valid data (DV2) will be lower in the game condition
    than the task condition. A two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test will be used to test
    whether the distribution of DV2 differs significantly between the game condition
    than the task condition. α = 0.05
