Appologies for the slow reply. Family illness meant that I had increased childcare responsibilities.

Thank you for your feedback.

I have used the new application form. Due to the different questions, the content has largely been re-written. The design of the study/processes has not changed, except from as mentioned below. I have tried to detail in particular the data protection questions.

Regarding data handling,

I have updated my procedure so that I will download the data to the University filestore and anonymise it on the University network via a VPN. It will only be analysed on my personal desktop computer in the anonymous form in which it will be published.

The server is within the jurisdiction of the GDPR and contractually obliged to keep the data secure. Due to the nature of the study,  there are no meaningful alternatives to such a server. Any viable alternative would involve a significantly higher cost. Hosting the server myself would almost certainly be less secure. The University does not provide a REST accessible database service. Configuring such a server would be highly time consuming.

Note that while the data is technically personal data under the GDPR, it is low risk. Essentially all I have is pseudononymous identifiers. If someone _already had_ a dataset that associated that identifier with a person, they could identify the participant data. Even then, the data collected has little to no relevance or sensitivity outside of the study, except for age, gender, and gaming experience.


Regarding vulnerable participants.

I do not know if my particpants fall under the various categories listed in the old form. In fact, as almost everyone in the UK is an NHS patient, they almost certainly do. However, I can make a reasonable assumption that _even if they do_ they are not vulnerable for the purposes of performing this experiment and to attempt to prevent them from participating on those grounds would be intrustive and discriminatory. Furthermore, such filtering, if it were possible, would harm the external validity of the study as I would be arbitrarily restricting the population from which I am sampling.

The phrasing of the question on the previous form provided the following categories:

* People with learning difficulties
* People who are unconscious or severely ill
* People with mental illness
* NHS patients
* Other vulnerable groups (if ‘yes’, please give details)

Having a learning difficulty, mental illness, severe illness, or being an NHS patient may have absolutely no effect on their ability to perform my study without harm, or to protect themselves from exploitation in the context of a study run on Prolific. Due to their being on Prolific, I know that a participant has accepted the terms and conditions of that platform. Thus I know that they are at least 18 and have capacity for entering into legally binding contracts (which is itself a point in the terms and conditions).

Under the Prolific terms and conditions, beginning a Prolific study is a form of contractual relationship between the participants and the researcher. Through the Prolific terms and conditions, the participant has asserted that they have capacity to read and understand said contract to decide whether or not it is appropriate for them to enter into it. Individuals who are unable to accept the terms and conditions in good faith (i.e. they do not have capacity) should have been prevented from joining by their care team, as the sole purpose of the platform is to fascilitate making these kinds of contract.

There could not be a question that Prolfic could ask to assess vulnerablity for deciding to begin and undertaking this study. Any participant who would be considered vulnerable for such a question could not join the platform in the first place.

As there is no well defined or identifiable group who would be particularly vulnerable _for this study_ while still being a member of the Prolific platform, it would be inappropriate for me to filter participants using questions about specific disabilities/illnesses/etc., as to do so would almost certainly be over-broad and discriminatory. For the same reason, there are not any groups I can warn in the study description not to participate. The appropriate procaution is to describe the activity and the information they will be asked to provide and allow the participant to make an informed decision whether to participate. I believe I already do this.

Because of the different wording of the new form, I have answered "No" to the question about vulnerable groups.
